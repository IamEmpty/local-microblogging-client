              %p As per usual the Le Web startup competition has been showcasing a smorgasbord of Europe’s hottest startups this week, and three stood out for the judges. But out of Easysize, Naturalcycles and Jukedeck, it was Jukedeck which won the top prize in the end.

              %p The AiO is a closed box that contains a full ABS 3D printing system as well as a laser 3D scanner. A turntable under the built platform spins objects slowly as a laser takes in their contours and the resulting objects can be printed directly from the scanning software. It is literally a 3D copier with true object-in/object-out systems. In short, it is a Star Trekian replicator – within reason.
